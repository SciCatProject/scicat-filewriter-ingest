# Scicat Filewriter Ingest

## About

A daemon that creates a raw dataset using scicat interface whenever a new file is written by a file-writer.

## Configuration

You can use a json file to configure options.
There is a template, ``resources/config.sample.json`` you can copy/paste to make your own configuration file.

```bash
cp resources/config.sample.json config.20240405.json
```

Then ``scicat_ingestor`` will automatically use the configuration file.

## Developer's Guide

### Virtual Environments
We use [pip-compile-multi](https://pip-compile-multi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to maintain
the `pip` recipes under `requirements`.
Each `*.in` files have the dependencies for specific purposes and `*.txt` files are compiled frozen dependencies.
`base.in` is auto-generated by `make_base.py` script based on `pyproject.toml`,
but you can add/pin dependencies manually above the marker in the file.

We use [tox](#Tox) command, `tox -e deps` to freeze the dependencies.

### Pre-commit Hooks
We use `pre-commit` for formatting and static analysis of the code.
Once you clone the repository and set up the virtual environment (i.e. installed `requirements/dev.txt`)
you need to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html) by
```bash
pre-commit install
```
`pre-commit` will be hooked whenever you make a `git commit` and screen the files of interest.

It will not pass CI test if `pre-commit` complains.
If you want to push the change while having a PR open, even if you know that `pre-commit hooks` fail,
you can add `[ci-skip]` tag in your commit and CI action will be skipped.

### Copier Template
This repository was based on [scipp/copier_template](https://github.com/scipp/copier_template).
We can apply common updates/dependency updates using
```bash
copier update
```

### Tox
`tox` controls virtual environment and commands for various purposes.
Developers and CI actions can use the command.
For example, `tox -e docs` builds documentation under `./html` directory and `tox -e py310` will run unit tests with python version `3.10`.
